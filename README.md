## Donations
There is now a donations button in the top right corner of the page. I decided to start accepting donations to help further HL and other addons. Recently I have had extra time to devote to coding since I lost my job. Any donations in any amount would really go a long way. I do not know if it is against terms or not but Im looking into making it so if you do donate your name will be on HotLoot under contributors. Thank you and thanks for using HL.
